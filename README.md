we want to multiply two 32-bit numbers in assembly

we want to implement this program for 8086 processor

8086 doesn't have 32-bit register, so calculations must be implemented with the help of two 16-bit registers.

The calculation part of this program is written as a procedure and the variables are sent to this procedure using the stack.
